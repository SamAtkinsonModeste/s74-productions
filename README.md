# S74 Productions – Performing Arts & Entertainment (Static Site)

This is a single-page marketing website I designed and built for **S74 Productions**, a performing arts company that
provides creative direction and choreography for stage and screen.

I created this project while studying for my **Front-End Web Development Techdegree at Treehouse**, applying my growing
HTML and CSS skills to a real-world client brief. As a student developer, I handled every stage — from visual design and
media editing to layout implementation — delivering a fully responsive static site.

> The site features a custom background, logo, and promotional video that I edited myself, showcasing both
> design and front-end creativity.
